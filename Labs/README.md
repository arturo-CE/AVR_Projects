# Lab Assignments

Below are a series of labratory assignments I have completed that programmed the ATmega1284 microcontroller using Atmel Studious 7.0. The programming language used is **C**.

### Lab 6
The problems in this lab require the use of **Synchronous State Machines** and **Internal Timers**.

### Lab 7 
The problems in this lab require the use of a **LCD Module 1602A-1**.

### Lab 8 
The problems in this lab require the use of a **Analog to Digital Converter(ADC)**.

### Lab 9
The problems in this lab require the use of a **Pulse Width Modulator(PWM)**.

### Lab 10 
The problems in this lab require the use of **Concurrent Synchronous State Machines** and **Internal Timers**.

### Lab 11 
The problems in this lab require the use of a **Task Scheduler for State Machines**.
