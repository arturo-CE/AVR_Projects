# Millipede Adaptation
Millipede is a vertically oriented fixed shooter game. It gives the user control of a character that is fixed to the very bottom of the screen. The user is able to move the character in the left and right directions while also being able to shoot from any of its positions

## Objective 
To eliminate the 4 cascading targets/bugs before any of them are able to reach the character's position. A winning screen :) will appear if the user is able to exteriminate all four bugs prior to them reaching the last row. A losing screen :(  will appear if any of the bugs are able to reach the last row and sting the character.
